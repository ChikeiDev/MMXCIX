# Project MMXCIX
### **The beginning of something awesome!**

This project is a long-term project I'll be dedicating my time to when I feel like it, this means that this project may have times where it won't receive a ton of attention by myself< and other times where I'll just be pushing updates like a mad-man. Eitherway, the main purpose of this project is to eventually have a finished product that can be enjoyed by the people.
